•	Use a data structure like a hash table or trie to store and index document text.
•	Implement algorithms for text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, stop word removal).
•	Utilize string matching algorithms (e.g., Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore) for finding plagiarized text segments.
•	Implement similarity measures like cosine similarity, Jaccard index, or n-gram matching.
•	Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical) to group similar documents.
•	Implement efficient data structures (e.g., suffix arrays, suffix trees) for pattern matching.
•	Handle large document collections using techniques like shingling or locality-sensitive hashing.
•	Provide a user interface for uploading documents and displaying plagiarism detection results.
•	Integrate with external document sources or databases for comprehensive checking.
